   Here is an example:
EXAMPLES:
   Q: A movie theater sold 350 tickets for a show. Adult tickets cost $12 and child tickets cost $7. If the total revenue was $3,400, how many adult tickets were sold?
   A: Let a = number of adult tickets and c = number of child tickets.
   We have two equations:
   1) a + c = 350 (total tickets)
   2) 12a + 7c = 3400 (total revenue)
   
   From equation 1: c = 350 - a
   Substitute into equation 2: 12a + 7(350 - a) = 3400
   12a + 2450 - 7a = 3400
   5a = 3400 - 2450
   5a = 950
   a = 190
   
   The answer is: 190

        | EXAMPLES:
        |    Q: A school is organizing a field trip for students and teachers. Each student ticket costs $10 and each teacher ticket costs $15. The total revenue from selling tickets was $1,200 and they sold a total of 50 tickets. How many students attended the field trip?
        |    A: Let s = number of student tickets and t = number of teacher tickets.
        |    We have two equations:
        |    1) s + t = 50  (total tickets)
        |    2) 10s  + 15t  = 1200  (total revenue)
        |    
        |    From equation 1: t  = 50  - s
        |    Substitute into equation 2: 10s  + 15(50 - s)  = 1200
        |    10s  + 750  - 15s  = 1200
        |    -5s  =  450
        |    s  =  90
