INITIAL PROMPT
============================================================
TASK_INSTRUCTION:
   Solve the following math word problem step by step.
TASK_DETAIL:
   Read the problem carefully. Identify the key numbers and operations needed. Break down complex problems into smaller steps. Show all your calculations clearly.
OUTPUT_FORMAT:
   End your response with 'The answer is: [NUMBER]' where [NUMBER] is the final numerical answer.
EXAMPLE_HINTER:
   Here is an example:
EXAMPLES:
   Q: A movie theater sold 350 tickets for a show. Adult tickets cost $12 and child tickets cost $7. If the total revenue was $3,400, how many adult tickets were sold?
   A: Let a = number of adult tickets and c = number of child tickets.
   We have two equations:
   1) a + c = 350 (total tickets)
   2) 12a + 7c = 3400 (total revenue)
   
   From equation 1: c = 350 - a
   Substitute into equation 2: 12a + 7(350 - a) = 3400
   12a + 2450 - 7a = 3400
   5a = 3400 - 2450
   5a = 950
   a = 190
   
   The answer is: 190
