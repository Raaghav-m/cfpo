   Here is an example:
EXAMPLES:
   Q: A movie theater sold 350 tickets for a show. Adult tickets cost $12 and child tickets cost $7. If the total revenue was $3,400, how many adult tickets were sold?
   A: Let a = number of adult tickets and c = number of child tickets.
   We have two equations:
   1) a + c = 350 (total tickets)
   2) 12a + 7c = 3400 (total revenue)
   
   From equation 1: c = 350 - a
   Substitute into equation 2: 12a + 7(350 - a) = 3400
   12a + 2450 - 7a = 3400
   5a = 3400 - 2450
   5a = 950
   a = 190
   
   The answer is: 190

        |    
        |     """Q: A library has 480 books on a shelf, consisting of fiction and non-fiction books. The ratio of fiction books to non-fiction books is 3:5. If x represents the number of fiction books, then how many non-fiction books are there?
        |    A: Let x = number of fiction books and y = number of non-fiction books.
        |    We have two parts of information:
        |    1) x + y = 480 (total books)
        |    2) x/y = 3/5 (ratio of fiction to non-fiction books)
        |    
        |    From the ratio: 5x = 3y
        |    y = (5/3)x
        |    Substitute into equation 1: x + (5/3)x = 480
        |    (8/3)x = 480
        |    x = 180
        |    y = (5/3)*180 = 300

        |    Q: A movie theater sold 350 tickets for a show. Adult tickets cost $12 and child tickets cost $7. If the total revenue was $3,400, how many adult tickets were sold?
        |    A: Let a = number of adult tickets and c = number of child tickets.
        |    We have two equations:

        |    Q: A movie theater sold 350 tickets for a show. Adult tickets cost $12 and child tickets cost $7. If the total revenue was $3,400, how many adult tickets were sold?
        |    A: Let a = number of adult tickets and c = number of child tickets.
        |    We have two equations:
        |    1) a + c = 350 (total tickets)
        |    2) 12a + 7c = 3400 (total revenue)
        |    
        |    From equation 1: c = 350 - a
        |    Substitute into equation 2: 12a + 7(350 - a) = 3400
        |    12a + 2450 - 7a = 3400
        |    5a = 3400 - 2450
        |    5a = 950
        |    a = 190

        |    The answer is: 190
        | COT_HINTER:

   | EXAMPLES:
   |    I will choose option 1: ADD one new example
   |    
   |     Here's the new EXAMPLES section with an additional example:
   |    
   |     """Q: A library has 480 books on a shelf, consisting of fiction and non-fiction books. The ratio of fiction books to non-fiction books is 3:5. If x represents the number of fiction books, then how many non-fiction books are there?
   |    A: Let x = number of fiction books and y = number of non-fiction books.
   |    We have two parts of information:
   |    1) x + y = 480 (total books)
   |    2) x/y = 3/5 (ratio of fiction to non-fiction books)
   |    
   |    From the ratio: 5x = 3y
   |    y = (5/3)x
   |    Substitute into equation 1: x + (5/3)x = 480
   |    (8/3)x = 480
   |    x = 180
   |    y = (5/3)*180 = 300
   |    
   |    The answer is: 300
   |    
   |    Q: A movie theater sold 350 tickets for a show. Adult tickets cost $12 and child tickets cost $7. If the total revenue was $3,400, how many adult tickets were sold?
   |    A: Let a = number of adult tickets and c = number of child tickets.
   |    We have two equations:
   |    1) a + c = 350 (total tickets)
   |    2) 12a + 7c = 3400 (total revenue)
   |    
   |    From equation 1: c = 350 - a
   |    Substitute into equation 2: 12a + 7(350 - a) = 3400
   |    12a + 2450 - 7a = 3400
   |    5a = 3400 - 2450
   |    5a = 950
   |    a = 190
   |    
   |    The answer is: 190"""

   | EXAMPLES:
   |    Q: A movie theater sold 350 tickets for a show. Adult tickets cost $12 and child tickets cost $7. If the total revenue was $3,400, how many adult tickets were sold?
   |    A: Let a = number of adult tickets and c = number of child tickets.
   |    We have two equations:
   |    1) a + c = 350 (total tickets)
   |    2) 12a + 7c = 3400 (total revenue)
   |    
   |    From equation 1: c = 350 - a
   |    Substitute into equation 2: 12a + 7(350 - a) = 3400
   |    12a + 2450 - 7a = 3400
   |    5a = 3400 - 2450
   |    5a = 950
   |    a = 190

   |    I will choose option 1: ADD one new example
   |    
   |     Here's the new EXAMPLES section with an additional example:
   |    
   |     """Q: A library has 480 books on a shelf, consisting of fiction and non-fiction books. The ratio of fiction books to non-fiction books is 3:5. If x represents the number of fiction books, then how many non-fiction books are there?
   |    A: Let x = number of fiction books and y = number of non-fiction books.
   |    We have two parts of information:
   |    1) x + y = 480 (total books)
   |    2) x/y = 3/5 (ratio of fiction to non-fiction books)
   |    
   |    From the ratio: 5x = 3y
   |    y = (5/3)x
   |    Substitute into equation 1: x + (5/3)x = 480
   |    (8/3)x = 480
   |    x = 180
   |    y = (5/3)*180 = 300
   |    
   |    The answer is: 300
   |    
   |    Q: A movie theater sold 350 tickets for a show. Adult tickets cost $12 and child tickets cost $7. If the total revenue was $3,400, how many adult tickets were sold?
   |    A: Let a = number of adult tickets and c = number of child tickets.
   |    We have two equations:
   |    1) a + c = 350 (total tickets)
   |    2) 12a + 7c = 3400 (total revenue)
   |    
   |    From equation 1: c = 350 - a
   |    Substitute into equation 2: 12a + 7(350 - a) = 3400
   |    12a + 2450 - 7a = 3400
   |    5a = 3400 - 2450
   |    5a = 950
   |    a = 190
   |    
   |    The answer is: 190"""

        |     """Q: A library has 480 books on a shelf, consisting of fiction and non-fiction books. The ratio of fiction books to non-fiction books is 3:5. If x represents the number of fiction books, then how many non-fiction books are there?
        |    A: Let x = number of fiction books and y = number of non-fiction books.
        |    We have two parts of information:
        |    1) x + y = 480 (total books)
        |    2) x/y = 3/5 (ratio of fiction to non-fiction books)
        |    
        |    From the ratio: 5x = 3y
        |    y = (5/3)x
        |    Substitute into equation 1: x + (5/3)x = 480
        |    (8/3)x = 480
        |    x = 180

   |    A: Let a = number of adult tickets and c = number of child tickets.
   |    We have two equations:
   |    1) a + c = 350 (total tickets)
   |    2) 12a + 7c = 3400 (total revenue)
   |    
   |    From equation 1: c = 350 - a
   |    Substitute into equation 2: 12a + 7(350 - a) = 3400
   |    12a + 2450 - 7a = 3400
   |    5a = 3400 - 2450

   | TASK_INSTRUCTION:
   |    ```markdown
   |    <TASK_INSTRUCTION>
   |    Solve mathematical word problems step by step, considering all given information and applying relevant mathematical concepts. For problems involving:
   |    
   |    - Compound interest: Clearly identify the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and frequency of compounding. Use the correct formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. When dealing with multiple interest rates or compounding periods, break down each step separately and calculate the total amount accordingly.
   |    
   |    - Multiple steps or sequences: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps. Identify key numbers, operations, and relationships between variables. Describe each step clearly and provide intermediate results.
   |    
   |    - Algebraic manipulations: For algebraic problems, clearly state the equations or formulas and apply the necessary algebraic manipulations (e.g., simplification, substitution, or elimination) to solve for the unknown variable. Show your work in detail, including any intermediate results.
   |    
   |    - Setting up equations or using formulas: Clearly state the equations or formulas and show your work in detail.
   | TASK_DETAIL:
   |    Read the problem carefully. Identify the key numbers and operations needed. Break down complex problems into smaller steps. Show all your calculations clearly.
   | OUTPUT_FORMAT:
   |    ```markdown
   |    <OUTPUT_FORMAT>
   |    End your response with 'The final answer is: [NUMBER]' or 'The solution is: [FINAL_RESULT]'. Ensure that your intermediate steps are clearly labeled and explained in your response.
   | EXAMPLES:
   |    Q: A movie theater sold 350 tickets for a show. Adult tickets cost $12 and child tickets cost $7. If the total revenue was $3,400, how many adult tickets were sold?
   |    A: Let a = number of adult tickets and c = number of child tickets.
   |    We have two equations:
   |    1) a + c = 350 (total tickets)
   |    2) 12a + 7c = 3400 (total revenue)
   |    
   |    From equation 1: c = 350 - a
   |    Substitute into equation 2: 12a + 7(350 - a) = 3400
   |    12a + 2450 - 7a = 3400
   |    5a = 3400 - 2450
   |    5a = 950
   |    a = 190
   |    
   |    The answer is: 190
