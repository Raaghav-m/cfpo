   |    
   |    ```markdown
   |    <TASK_INSTRUCTION>
   |    Solve the following math word problem step by step, considering multiple operations and complex calculations as needed. When faced with compound interest or other complex scenarios, be sure to:
   |    
   |    * Identify the initial principal amount, interest rate, and time period
   |    * Apply the compound interest formula or other relevant formulas as needed
   |    * Handle any withdrawals or reinvestments by updating the principal amount accordingly
   |    * Ensure accurate calculations and correct unit conversions (e.g., from percentages to decimal values)

   |    
   |    Original Example: A savings account earns 4% compound interest annually. If the initial deposit is $1,000 and the time period is 5 years, how much will the account balance be?
   |

   |    Break down complex calculations into manageable steps. When faced with multiple operations, consider the order of operations (PEMDAS) and handle each step separately. For instance:
   |    
   |    * Calculate the total interest earned after the initial 3-year period
   |    * Withdraw half the total amount and update the principal amount accordingly
   |    * Reinvest the remaining amount at 8% for 2 more years and calculate the final balance

TASK_INSTRUCTION:
   Solve the following math word problem step by step.

TASK_DETAIL:
   Read the problem carefully. Identify the key numbers and operations needed. Show your work clearly.

OUTPUT_FORMAT:
   Please provide your final numerical solution as 'The answer is: [NUMBER]'. Ensure that [NUMBER] is the exact numerical value that solves the math problem.

EXAMPLES:
   I will choose option 3: MODIFY an existing example to create a variation.
   
    Original Example: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more. How many does he have?
    
    Modified Example: John has 12 apples. He gives 4 to his friend. How many does he have left?
   
    The modified example adds a different scenario where John is giving away apples instead of buying them, making it a more varied example for the GSM8K task.
