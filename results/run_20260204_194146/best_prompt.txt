TASK_INSTRUCTION:
Solve the following math word problem step by step.

TASK_DETAIL:
Read the problem carefully. Identify the key numbers and operations needed. Show your work clearly.

OUTPUT_FORMAT:
Please provide your final numerical solution as 'The answer is: [NUMBER]'. Ensure that [NUMBER] is the exact numerical value that solves the math problem.

EXAMPLE_HINTER:
Here is an example:

EXAMPLES:
I will choose option 3: MODIFY an existing example to create a variation.

 Original Example: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more. How many does he have?
 
 Modified Example: John has 12 apples. He gives 4 to his friend. How many does he have left?

 The modified example adds a different scenario where John is giving away apples instead of buying them, making it a more varied example for the GSM8K task.

 The complete new EXAMPLES section is:
 """Q: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more. How many does he have?
A: John starts with 5 apples. He buys 3 more. Total = 5 + 3 = 8 apples.
The answer is: 8
Q: John has 12 apples. He gives 4 to his friend. How many does he have left?
A: John starts with 12 apples. He gives 4 away. Total = 12 - 4 = 8 apples.
The answer is: 8
